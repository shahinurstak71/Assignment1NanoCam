Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google.

It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia,[4] and the web from a single codebase.

The first version of Flutter was known as codename "Sky" and ran on the Android operating system.


Flutter apps are written in the Dart language and make use of many of the language's more advanced features.

 Most developers interact with Flutter via the Flutter Framework, which provides a reactive framework and a set of platform, layout, and foundation widgets.
